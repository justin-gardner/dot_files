# Home-Manager

## Setup Instructions

- Must have nix installed
- Clone this repo to ~/dot_files
- Run the command `home-manager switch --flake ~/dot_files/nix/home-manager#justin`
- Run `tide configure` to set up the prompt.  This is not set up with home manager, but does persist after configuring it the first time.
